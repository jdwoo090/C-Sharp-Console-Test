# C-Sharp-Console-Test
This form, coded in C#, will ask the user for different information and if he so chooses will relay it back to him.
This form requests personal information but will neither save nor share any of the information. If you decide that
you do not want to share your information, simply do not enter correct information, it will still work. This test
is for school, and is as such a simple project and not intended to be used as a complex form. However, if you can
find a use for it as such, you have full permission to use it as long as this program is not harmed and I get credit
where credit is needed.
